## [0.18.0] - 2022-07-21

### Bug Fixes

- Made application agent less verbose for logging
- Spawn tasks for actual CLA transmission in actor instead of blocking
- Tcpcl now spawns a new tokio task for new connections
- Seeing an already known peer did not update its last seen timestamp, now it gets touched on any new beacon
