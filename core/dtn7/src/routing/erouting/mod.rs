/*

    The External Routing allows implementing routing algorithms externally (e.g. outside the dtn7-rs codebase).
    It works by exposing a realtime JSON API via WebSocket. With the help of the erouting it is possible to easily
    implement new routing algorithms in different languages. All languages that can encode / decode JSON
    and communicate via WebSocket should in theory work.
